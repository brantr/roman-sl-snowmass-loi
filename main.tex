\noindent {\large \bf Abstract:}
\emph{Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope}, formerly known as 
the \emph{Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope}, is scheduled to launch in the mid-2020's and will provide a
multi-band, high-resolution view of the cosmos. Equipped with a mirror the size of \emph{Hubble
Space Telescope} and a $0.3~\mathrm{deg}^2$ infrared-sensitive camera $\sim100\times$ larger than \emph{Hubble/Wide Field Camera 3},
\RST will efficiently and sensitively map large areas of the sky with $\sim0.1$'' resolution.
This resolution will enable the discovery of $\sim 1000$ gravitationally-lensed quasars, which 
in turn provide detailed constraints on the properties of dark matter substructures. We
review the promise of \RST for achieving dark matter constraints through strong lensing,
both as stand-alone lensing experiment and in collaboration with other facilities.

\emph{Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope} (\RST) is a 2.4m space telescope scheduled 
to be launched in the
mid-2020's by the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)\citep{spergel2015a,akeson2019a}.
Formerly known as the \emph{Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope}, \RST will undertake
an ambitious set of mission surveys including a large area cosmology survey ($\sim 1600~\mathrm{deg}^2$)
with multiband imaging ($\sim26.7$AB flux limit) and slitless grism spectroscopy ($\sim10^{-16}~\mathrm{deg}~\mathrm{s}^{-1}~\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ line sensitivity).

While the cosmology mission surveys are designed to constrain structure formation and the
expansion history through weak lensing and baryon acoustic oscillations, 
\RST can test our picture for small-scale dark matter structure formation more
directly through gravitational lensing. The cold dark matter plus cosmological constant ($\Lambda$CDM)
paradigm forms one of the pillars of our models for the origin and evolution of cosmic structures.
While remarkably successful at matching observations on large scales, there have been persistent
observational challenges to the cold, collisionless dark matter expectations on dwarf-galaxy
scales. These “small-scale controversies” may simply stem from a poor understanding of the
baryonic processes involved in galaxy formation, or indicate more complex dark sector physics\citep{bullock2017a}.

Detailed testing of the standard paradigm on small scales remains one of the most pressing issues
in cosmology. Numerical simulations in $\Lambda$CDM predict a rich spectrum of substructure in galaxy
halos. Small fluctuations in the galaxy-scale lensing potential caused by these substructures
should result in measurable “flux anomalies” in the magnifications of quadruply-lensed quasar
images \citep{metcalf2001a}. While discrepancies between the observed flux ratios and
those predicted by a smooth lens model may have been found in radio quasar lenses \citep{mao1998a,dalal2002a,metcalf2002a}, the small sample size ($\lesssim100$
lenses) of current samples limits our understanding. \RST HLS will revolutionize this field
by increasing the sample of quad lenses more than 10$\times$ \citep{oguri2010a}.
More recently, methods have been developed to use extended lensed sources, in addition to the
point-like AGN, to identify substructures through distortions of lensed images. Extended sources
are imaged into arcs and rings that probe a larger volume in the lens halo, increasing the number
of subhalos that can be sensed. They also can be drawn from larger populations of background
sources, typical galaxies rather than bright AGN. \cite[Vegetti \& Koopman (2009)][]{vegetti2009a} described a
method for identifying subtrsuctures with high-resolution optical/IR imaging of extended
galaxies, with \cite[Vegetti et al. (2012)][]{vegetti2012a} reporting a detection of a dark substructure in a gravitational
lens at $z=0.9$. 
In related work, \cite[Hezaveh et al. (2013, 2016a)][]{hezaveh2013a,hezaveh2016a} described the use of (sub-)millimeter
spectral lines from dusty lensed galaxies to search for subhalos in the lenses. The wide survey
area of HLS, along with its combination of multi-band imaging and spectroscopy, will provide
many avenues for identifying large samples of lensed galaxies for such substructure searches.
